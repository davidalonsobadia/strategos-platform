"""Pydantic v2 schemas for the projects (Proyectos) domain.

These are the API shapes Strategos exposes to its own frontend. They are mapped
from the Business Central transport DTOs
(:class:`~app.integrations.business_central.models.BCProject`) in the service —
the domain has no database model because projects live in Business Central.

Only the **General** section of the project fitxa is modelled here; the
obligation checklist subsections are owned by a separate domain (issue #9).
