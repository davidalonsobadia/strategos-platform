"""Business logic for the obligations (Obligaciones) domain.

The service reads obligations read-only from Business Central via the injected
:class:`~app.integrations.business_central.client.BusinessCentralClient` port
(never from fixtures directly). It exposes two things:

* the obligation **catalog** (``BCObligation`` DTOs mapped to
  :class:`~app.domains.obligations.schemas.ObligationTypeResponse`), and
* the **per-project instances** (``BCProjectObligation`` DTOs), enriched with the
  obligation, project and client display names and a **derived** due state.

The due state is computed by the pure :func:`derive_status` helper against a
reference date supplied by the caller (the router injects the server date; tests
freeze it), so it can be asserted deterministically without patching the clock.
