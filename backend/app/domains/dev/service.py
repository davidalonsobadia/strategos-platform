"""Dev-only orchestration of the mock BOPA → Alerts pipeline.

This wires together the three existing pipeline stages so the whole flow can be
exercised locally with no external services, purely against committed fixtures:

1. **Ingest + persist** — :meth:`BopaService.sync_latest` run against a
   :class:`MockBopaClient` pointed at the crafted demo fixtures
   (:data:`DEMO_BULLETINS` / :data:`DEMO_DOCUMENTS`), whose document titles embed
   real Business Central customer/project names so the next stage finds matches.
2. **Analyze** — the ``bopa.analyze_matches`` task body reads the persisted
   documents plus the (mock) BC customers/projects, writes ``BopaMatch`` rows and
   creates BOPA/Client alerts.
3. **Obligation alerts** — the ``alerts.generate_obligation_alerts`` task body
   turns due BC obligations into Obligation alerts.

Every stage delegates to existing, unchanged code, so this adds no business logic
of its own. It is idempotent: sync skips already-complete bulletins, analysis
skips already-logged bulletins, and obligation-alert creation is guarded by a
unique constraint — so re-running leaves the counts unchanged.

The two task bodies open their own ``SessionLocal`` (they normally run outside a
request scope), so they operate on the configured database rather than the ``db``
session passed here; locally both point at the same database, so the summary read
back through ``db`` sees everything they committed.
