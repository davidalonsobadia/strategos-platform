"""Celery tasks for the Alerts domain.

Houses the daily task that turns Business Central obligations into alerts. Like
the BOPA tasks it runs outside FastAPI's request scope, so it builds its own DB
session (``SessionLocal``) and BC client (``get_business_central_client``) rather
than using ``Depends``.
