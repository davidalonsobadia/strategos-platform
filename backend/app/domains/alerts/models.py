"""SQLAlchemy models for the Alerts domain.

The Alerts domain is the platform's unified notification center. Unlike the
Tareas domain (a hybrid), alerts are fully native to this database; they track
the lifecycle of notifications linked to specific customers.

An alert is one of two **types** (discriminated by ``alert_type``):

* ``BOPA`` — a customer/project match found in an official bulletin, linked to a
  :class:`~app.domains.bopa.models.BopaMatch` via ``bopa_match_id``. Created by
  the BOPA analysis cronjob.
* ``OBLIGATION`` — a Business Central obligation ("Obligación") whose
  notification date has arrived, keyed by the opaque external ``bc_obligation_id``
  (no physical FK — BC data lives externally). Created by the daily
  ``alerts.generate_obligation_alerts`` task.

Each alert serves as a collaboration trigger, letting staff acknowledge or
discard notifications. Alert states are persisted locally to ensure stateful
tracking (New/Viewed/Discarded) without write-back to external systems.

State is intentionally **global** (shared by every user), not per-user: an
alert's ``status`` is a single shared column and ``user_id`` is left NULL to mean
"for all users". Two unique constraints keep the generators idempotent —
``uq_alert_bopa_match`` (one alert per BOPA match) and ``uq_alert_bc_obligation``
(one alert per BC obligation, ever). Both columns are nullable and only one is
set per row; multiple NULLs are permitted by a unique constraint on Postgres and
SQLite, so the two alert types never collide.
