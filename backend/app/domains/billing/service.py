"""Business logic for the billing (Facturación / Costes) domain.

Everything is aggregated **read-only** from Business Central via the injected
:class:`~app.integrations.business_central.client.BusinessCentralClient` port;
nothing is persisted. The financial model (confirmed with the product owner):

* **Income / billing** = sales-invoice line amounts **minus** credit-memo line
  amounts. Credit memos are *facturas rectificativas* that reduce billing — they
  are never a cost.
* **Cost** = ``jobLedgerEntries`` usage cost (``total_cost_lcy``) only.
* **Hours** = ``timeSheetPostingEntries`` quantity, rolled up per project.

A sales line links to its header on ``document_no``; the header carries the
customer, so per-customer billing needs the header→customer map, while
per-project billing/cost/hours group on the line/entry ``project_id`` (BC
``jobNo``).
